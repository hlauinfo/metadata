# Some of My Work

I have mostly been writing Solidity smart contracts the past couple years. All smart contract work that I've pushed to mainnet is source available. Here are a few things I've shipped. The nicer Starta front-ends were built by my cofounder Tushar.

## [Starta x Degen Bridge](https://degen.starta.exchange)

The Starta x Degen bridge is the first zero-fee bridge into Degen L3. It was also the only bridge which didn't suffer a loss of funds during the 1.6 million block re-org that we detected early on.

## [Memedex](https://memedex.meme)

Memedex TL1 is the first index token sourced from Farcaster trending token link data. Users can mint and redeem fixed-weight index tokens for the underlying assets.

## [Starta Loans](https://starta.loans)

Starta is a net-new lending protocol design that I've been working on for the past year. It is the easiest way for people who are unfamiliar with DeFi to get a great DeFi loan and is currently undergoing beta testing on Base Sepolia. More technical details will be shared soon.

## Fairo

Fairo is the first post-quantum end-to-end encrypted (E2EE) messenger on Ethereum. It used calldata inscriptions for maximal gas efficiency on ETH mainnet. Client will be restored in the coming months.
